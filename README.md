smbx-epmanager-ver3
===================

Version 3 of the new episode manager. Get your body ready.

Currently being coded in C# with the help of .NET Framework 4.5, the new SMBX Episode Manager will be more focused around the updating of individual episodes rather than just housing an index of episodes to install.

NEW
===
-Episodes will now have a project.index file assosciated with them that the program will be able to read. I will release a tool for creating/editing these .index files in the future.
-The index file contains the Episode name, author, description, version, forum link, server, files list. All of these are crucial in the updating process.
-You can also generate a "changes.index" file  which will be read from a server so the program knows what to download/replace.
-New, Modern UI based design. Don't worry, it should work 100% with Windows 7 and Windows 8 desktop. I cannot guarantee compatibility with older versions of Windows.


TO-DO
=====

-Finish the initial UI
-Code the main program.
